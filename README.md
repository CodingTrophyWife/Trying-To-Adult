Discription:

This is an adult work scheduler for the type of adults I hope I never become! Honestly I dont get the idea of working a 9 to 5 job where you are so busy that you have to actually tasks down. I have never been to a meeting where I didnt get a text message 5 min before to remind me. But I guess there are people who would benefit from it!


Shout Out's (Contributing):

My hubby, bless his heart, for having the patience to deal with me! Im getting better at asking less for help from him but I still do need him every once in awhile when I break everything and my computer starts having smoke come from it.

Usage:
click on the time black and type in your task and click the save button! If it becomes past due the bar will turn red. The bar will be green if its that hour and blue for the future! You can delete the task when your finished!
